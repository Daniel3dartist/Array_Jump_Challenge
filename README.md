# Python Array Jump Challenge

In this challenge, you must submit a code that counts the jumps from the list item with the highest value, you must go through the list and return to the starting position with the lowest number of jumps. The displacement is defined by the value of the current index item, the value received will define the number of jumps, if you go beyond the minimum index value (0) or the maximum (list size), you must continue counting from the other end of the list.
